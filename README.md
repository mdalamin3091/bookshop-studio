### Overview

In this project, we aim to create a contemporary e-commerce website with a focus on performance, maintainability, and a sleek user interface. To achieve this, we will leverage the Mantine UI component library for our front-end design and Sass for styling. All our API calls will be implemented using Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query), and the website will follow server-side rendering (SSR) principles for optimal SEO and user experience.

### Key Objectives:

1. Homepage Design: We will design an engaging and user-friendly homepage using Mantine UI components. This will include features like product carousels, navigation menus, and product categories, all seamlessly integrated into a visually appealing layout.

2. Product Details Page: The product details page will provide in-depth information about each product. We'll leverage Mantine UI for components like product images, descriptions, and interactive elements. Users will have the ability to view and purchase products with ease.

3. API Integration: All data retrieval and management will be handled through RTK Query, ensuring efficient API calls and a smooth user experience. This includes fetching product details, user profiles, and any other necessary data.

4. Folder Structure: We'll maintain a well-structured project folder hierarchy to keep our codebase organized and easily maintainable. Components, Redux slices, styles, and utility functions will be neatly organized.

5. Server-Side Rendering: The website will utilize server-side rendering for faster initial page loads, improved SEO, and optimal user experience. This will be achieved using libraries like Next.js or a similar SSR framework
